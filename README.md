# Microbiome Community Resource Catalogue (MiCoReCa)

The rapid growth of microbiome research has led to the development of numerous bioinformatics tools and databases, but information about them remains fragmented across disparate, often outdated cataloging efforts, hindering resource discovery and utilization.

To address this critical gap, the [ELIXIR Microbiome Community](https://elixir-europe.org/communities/microbiome) collaborates with the [Research Software Ecosystem](https://research-software-ecosystem.github.io/) to create MiCoReCa (Microbiome Community Resource Catalogue), a comprehensive, dynamic, open-access catalogue of microbiome-related bioinformatics resources:
- Tools from [Research Software Ecosystem Atlas](https://research-software-ecosystem.github.io/RSEc-Atlas/)
- Workflows from [WorkflowHub](https://workflowhub.eu/)
- Training
- Standards
- Databases

The extraction, filtering and curation are done following the workflow below and using the defined keywords in the [`keywords.yml` file](keywords.yml):

![A workflow diagram illustrating the process for populating the RSEC Atlas, starting with 'Scrapping' resources from Bioconda, WorkflowHub, and Elixir, which yields over 40,000 tools and 1,300 workflows. This pool is reduced by the 'Filtering for Microbiome Resources' step to about 5,000 tools and 600 workflows. After 'Community Curation,' the items are 'Displayed on RSEC Atlas.' A detailed flowchart on the right explains the filtering logic: it sequentially checks if EDAM topics are found, if defined keywords are in the tags, if keywords are in the title, and finally if keywords are in the description. A 'Yes' at any step classifies the item as a 'MiCoCo resource,' while a 'No' at all steps classifies it as 'Not a MiCoCo resource.'](doc/main_figure_poster.png)

# Prepare environment

- Install virtualenv (if not already there)

    ```
    $ python3 -m pip install --user virtualenv
    ```

- Create virtual environment

    ```
    $ python3 -m venv env
    ```

- Activate virtual environment

    ```
    $ source env/bin/activate
    ```

- Install requirements

    ```
    $ python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

# Extract workflows from WorkflowHub

- Extract all workflows metadata from WorkflowHub as a JSON file

    ```
    $ python bin/extract_workflowhub.py \
        extract \
        --all content/workflowhub/workflows_full.json
    ```

- Filter workflows based on keywords and EDAM terms

    ```
    $ python bin/extract_workflowhub.py \
        filter \
        --all content/workflowhub/workflows_full.json \
        --filtered content/workflowhub/workflows_filtered.json \
        --tsv-filtered content/workflowhub/workflows_filtered.tsv \
        --tags keywords.yml \
        --status content/workflowhub/workflows_status.tsv
    ```

    As explained in the decision tree above, workflows are filtered first on EDAM terms (topics and operations), then on tags, workflow name and finally description based on the keywords provided in `keywords.yml` file.


## Extract tools from RSEC

- Clone the RSEC repository and filter tools based on EDAM terms and keywords defined in `keywords.yml`. Validated tools are written to a JSON and a TSV file.

    ```
    $ python bin/extract_rsec.py
    ```

    Custom output paths can be provided if needed:

    ```
    $ python bin/extract_rsec.py \
        --kw keywords.yml \
        --json-output content/rsec/infos/validated_tools_metadata.json \
        --tsv-output content/rsec/infos/validated_tools_summary.tsv
    ```

    Tools are filtered against three successive criteria: EDAM topics/operations from bio.tools metadata, keywords and acronyms from BioContainers metadata, then the same matching applied to free-text descriptions from bio.tools, BioContainers and Galaxy. A tool is kept if it passes any of them.

# Bioconda

- Extract all bioconda metadata as a JSON file

    ```
    mkdir -p ./tmp

    # download ZIP file *into tmp/*
    wget -O ./tmp/bioconda-recipes.zip https://codeload.github.com/bioconda/bioconda-recipes/zip/master

    # unzip from tmp into tmp/
    unzip ./tmp/bioconda-recipes.zip -d ./tmp/

    # remove the ZIP after extraction
    rm ./tmp/bioconda-recipes.zip

    # run your Python script
    python bin/collect_bioconda_recipes.py \
        --bioconda-path ./tmp/bioconda-recipes-master/recipes \
        --keywords-file ./keywords.yml \
        --output-file ./content/bioconda_filtered.json

    # cleanup
    rm -r ./tmp
    ```

- Curate workflows based on community curation
    
    ```
    $ python bin/extract_workflowhub.py \
        curate \
        --filtered content/workflowhub/workflows_filtered.json \
        --curated content/workflowhub/workflows_curated.json \
        --tsv-curated content/workflowhub/workflows_curated.tsv \
        --status content/workflowhub/workflows_status.tsv
    ```

    This keeps only workflows in the scope of microbiome analysis. 

- Extract tools used in curated workflows as JSON

    ```
    $ python bin/extract_workflowhub.py \
        extract_tools \
        --workflows content/workflowhub/workflows_curated.json \
        --tools content/workflowhub/tools_from_workflows.json
    ```
