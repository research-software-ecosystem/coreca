# Microbiome Community Resource Catalogue (MiCoReCa)

The rapid growth of microbiome research has led to the development of numerous bioinformatics tools and databases, but information about them remains fragmented across disparate, often outdated cataloging efforts, hindering resource discovery and utilization.

To address this critical gap, the [ELIXIR Microbiome Community](https://elixir-europe.org/communities/microbiome) collaborates with the [Research Software Ecosystem](https://research-software-ecosystem.github.io/) to create MiCoReCa (Microbiome Community Resource Catalogue), a comprehensive, dynamic, open-access catalogue of microbiome-related bioinformatics resources:
- Tools from [Research Software Ecosystem Atlas](https://research-software-ecosystem.github.io/RSEc-Atlas/)
- Workflows from [WorkflowHub](https://workflowhub.eu/)
- Training
- Standards
- Databases

The extraction, filtering and curation are done following the workflow below and using the defined keywords in the [`keywords.yml` file](keywords.yml):

![A workflow diagram illustrating the process for populating the RSEC Atlas, starting with 'Scrapping' resources from Bioconda, WorkflowHub, and Elixir, which yields over 40,000 tools and 1,300 workflows. This pool is reduced by the 'Filtering for Microbiome Resources' step to about 5,000 tools and 600 workflows. After 'Community Curation,' the items are 'Displayed on RSEC Atlas.' A detailed flowchart on the right explains the filtering logic: it sequentially checks if EDAM topics are found, if defined keywords are in the tags, if keywords are in the title, and finally if keywords are in the description. A 'Yes' at any step classifies the item as a 'MiCoCo resource,' while a 'No' at all steps classifies it as 'Not a MiCoCo resource.'](doc/main_figure_poster.png)

# Prepare environment

- Install virtualenv (if not already there)

    ```
    $ python3 -m pip install --user virtualenv
    ```

- Create virtual environment

    ```
    $ python3 -m venv env
    ```

- Activate virtual environment

    ```
    $ source env/bin/activate
    ```

- Install requirements

    ```
    $ python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

# Extract workflows from WorkflowHub

- Extract all workflows metadata from WorkflowHub as a JSON file

    ```
    $ python bin/extract_workflowhub.py \
        extract \
        --all communities/all/workflowhub/workflows_full.json
    ```

- Create the metadata folder for your community
    ```
    community="biodiversity"
    mkdir communities/${community}
    mkdir communities/${community}/metadata
    ```

- Create the keywords file for you community in the newly created metadata folder

- Filter workflows based on keywords and EDAM terms

    ```
    community="microbiome"
    $ python bin/extract_workflowhub.py \
        filter \
        --all communities/all/workflowhub/workflows_full.json \
        --filtered communities/${community}/workflowhub/workflows_filtered.json \
        --tsv-filtered communities/${community}/workflowhub/workflows_filtered.tsv \
        --tags communities/${community}/metadata/keywords.yml \
        --status communities/${community}/workflowhub/workflows_status.tsv
    ```

    As explained in the decision tree above, workflows are filtered first on EDAM terms (topics and operations), then on tags, workflow name and finally description based on the keywords provided in `keywords.yml` file.


# Tools from RSEc

- Extract all metadata from RSEc

    ```
    $ python bin/extract_rsec.py \
        extract \
        --all communities/all/rsec/
    ```

- Filter RSEc tools based on keywords and EDAM terms, place them in content/rsec

    ```
    community="microbiome"
    $ python bin/extract_rsec.py \
        filter \
        --all communities/all/rsec/ \
        --json communities/${community}/rsec/validated_tools_metadata.json \
        --tsv communities/${community}/rsec/validated_tools_summary.tsv \
        --keywords communities/${community}/metadata/keywords.yml
    ```

    As explained in the decision tree above, workflows are filtered first on EDAM terms (topics and operations), then on tags, workflow name and finally description based on the keywords provided in `keywords.yml` file. 
    Workflows are filtered first on EDAM terms (topics and operations), then on tags, workflow name and finally description based on the keywords provided in "keywords.yml". 

# Bioconda

TODO : Test and improve

- Extract all bioconda metadata as a JSON file

    ```
    mkdir -p ./tmp

    # download ZIP file *into tmp/*
    wget -O ./tmp/bioconda-recipes.zip https://codeload.github.com/bioconda/bioconda-recipes/zip/master

    # unzip from tmp into tmp/
    unzip ./tmp/bioconda-recipes.zip -d ./tmp/

    # remove the ZIP after extraction
    rm ./tmp/bioconda-recipes.zip

    # run your Python script
    python bin/collect_bioconda_recipes.py \
        --bioconda-path ./tmp/bioconda-recipes-master/recipes \
        --keywords-file ./keywords.yml \
        --output-file ./content/bioconda_filtered.json

    # cleanup
    rm -r ./tmp
    ```

- Curate workflows based on community curation
    
    ```
    $ python bin/extract_workflowhub.py \
        curate \
        --filtered content/workflowhub/workflows_filtered.json \
        --curated content/workflowhub/workflows_curated.json \
        --tsv-curated content/workflowhub/workflows_curated.tsv \
        --status content/workflowhub/workflows_status.tsv
    ```

    This keeps only workflows in the scope of microbiome analysis. 

- Extract tools used in curated workflows as JSON

    ```
    $ python bin/extract_workflowhub.py \
        extract_tools \
        --workflows content/workflowhub/workflows_curated.json \
        --tools content/workflowhub/tools_from_workflows.json
    ```

# Run the unit tests locally

```
PYTHONPATH=bin python -m unittest discover -s bin/tests
```
